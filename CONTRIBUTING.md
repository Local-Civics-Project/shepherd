Overview
========
Local Civics Project is an open source project. Spreading true awareness of local civics comes with a responsibility to ensure our work is high quality since it will be viewed and scrutinized by the general public at large. We will follow the following guidelines for contributing code:

1. All your code is under GPL v3.0 license. [GPL v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)  basically lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. 

2. We follow a fairly simple [feature branch workflow of development](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). This means, if you want to contribute, start a new branch and when you're ready to merge, raise a Pull Request and get approvals to merge it to master. This also means that the master branch must, AT ALL TIMES, have running code.

3. Add code comments wherever possible. Code is read more than it is written.
